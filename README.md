# Pollution map

This is a small demo program which will display the longitude and latitiude of weather sensors on a world map, with radiuses corresponding to the sensor value.

Data can be drawn from the OpenAQ air quality database using the included python script, which will also format the data for this app.

In the future, I hope to expand this program to draw data from a more complete database, such as the London Air qulality database, which provides hourly updates.

This project would not have been possible without the R Shiny superzip example:
